# Telco Churn Prediction
This project utilizes data from Telco that details various aspects about their consumers such as the plans they are subscribed to, how much they pay, and their tenure with the company. I use pandas to handle the data and perform feature engineering, Scikit-Learn to create a random forest classifier model, and Matplotlib to graph the results. The model had an 80% accuracy and 0.51 F1 score.
